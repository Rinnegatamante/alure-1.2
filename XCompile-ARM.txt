# Cross-compiling requires CMake 2.6 or newer. To use it from build/, call it

# cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../XCompile.txt -DHOST=i686-pc-mingw32
# Where 'i686-pc-mingw32' is the host prefix for your cross-compiler. If you
# already have a toolchain file setup, you may use that instead of this file.

# the name of the target operating system
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)
